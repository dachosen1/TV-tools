Tools for the analysis of time-varying data.  Sometimes referred to as either long-form or panel data, this format allows multiple rows per subject over mutually exclusive time intervals.  The package provides tools for computing temporal descriptive statistics, data visualizations, extracting cross-sectional data, computing the time to events, and for calculating the rate of exposure to various factors over time.
