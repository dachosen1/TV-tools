## List of Functions

- cross.sectional.data
    + Creates a cross-sectional data set of all patients at a specific time point.
- create.baseline
    + Calls cross.sectional.data at time 0.
- crude.rates
    + Calculates the crude (unadjusted) rate of outcomes relative to the amount of follow-up time, e.g. the number of heart attacks per 100 patient-years of the use of a medication.
- era.splits
    + Reformats data around defined eras.  Those entries that overlap two eras are split into two rows of observations.
- exposure
    + Calculates the percentage exposure or utilization of certain variables (e.g. medication adherence) over a specified period of time.
- first.event
    + Calculates the time to the first event for each of a list of variables for each id.
- followup.time
    + Determines the length of observation for each id.
- missingness.rates.R
    + Computes the cross-sectional rate of missing data for a set of variables over time.
- missingness.plot.R
    + Plots the rate of missingness in variables over time.
- timeplot
    + Graphs a longitudinal history for each id.
- tvtools.R
    + Source File that calls all of the other functions.
